      "In Plato's Cave" from On Photography by Susan Sontag
    </h2>
    
   
      <p>
      After reading "In Plato's Cave" Chapter 1 by Susan Sontag, please write a one to three paragraph reflection on how you use photography and image making. How could you represent visually through photography or illustration or the combination of image and text notions of our world at this moment? Create a new html page for this reflection, title it “readings.html” and link to it from your class homepage (index.html). Add a link back to index.html on your readings.html page. Update the readings.html page with each reflection – project or reading reflection.
