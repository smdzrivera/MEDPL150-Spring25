     <span class="emphasis"> PART 1:</span> The opening chapter from Susan Sontag’s On Photography reflects upon the
power of image taking. Well before the advent of the smart phone, Sontag discusses the
ubiquity of the camera and image taking. This is the longest reading of the semester for
this course. The reading is assigned to place image making in a critical context. What
does it mean to you to capture images and create graphics? Through the length of the
semester, you will be asked to realize ten projects, each project quite different from the
other as you are asked to use various tools. Although each project is distinct, please
consider them as a body of work; consider how one may relate to the next and how you
as a media maker can build from one to the next. Please write a one to three paragraph
reflection on how you use photography and image making. How could you represent visually through photography or illustration or the combination of image and text notions
of our world at this moment? Create a new html page for this reflection, title it
“readings.html” and link to it from your class homepage (index.html). Add a link back to
index.html on your readings.html page. Update the readings.html page with each
reflection – project or reading reflection.

       <span class="emphasis"> PART 2:</span> Based on the composition and framing concepts that were covered in the lecture,
take at least five photos with lab DSLR cameras.<br> Choose the two images that you think are compositionally the most compelling and save
a copy of both images in their original pixel dimensions (in other words, keep a back-up
of the original file). Crop a copy of one of the images to 1920 px by 1080 px and crop a
copy of the other image to 5”x7”. Now, modify the Tonal Range of the two images using
an adjustment layer following the steps in the chapters above. Export these as jpg images
and make sure they are under 2 MB in their file size.<br>Now, add each photo to two new pages on your website. Place each of the cropped
images on a separate page and connect them with links to the home page and to each
other. Make sure that all pages can navigate back to the home page. On your image web
pages, add a paragraph tag to explain why you chose these two images and what
compositional ideas you were using to create visual interest.
