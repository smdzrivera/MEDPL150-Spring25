    <p>This homework assignment, to create a web-based non-linear story, is in two parts and counts as two homework assignments; we will be looking for a highly resolved work that builds on all of the technical and aesthetic material we’ve covered in class. For this assignment, you can use photography, illustration, montage, or simple text to create a narrative with multiple story paths that can be navigated using hyperlinks. 80% of the imagery and all of the text used must be your own original content.</p><br>
<ol><li>Map out your narrative, using illustrator or simply a pen and paper.</li>
<li>Develop the imagery/text for each page.</li>
  <li>In your <a href="https://cuny620-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/santiago_mendezrivera21_myhunter_cuny_edu/EtWNkxvuxZNNrSA2LY49wgwBAwsh64zt7ROrnpJfqzeH7g?e=fl7Re8" target="_blank">MEDPL150 folder</a>, create a new folder named story. In this new folder, create an images folder. Save your html file for this project, including a new index.html, directly in the new folder. If you are using external style sheets, include an external .css file in the folder as well. Images should be jpg, 72ppi and no larger than 5” x 6”, make sure your images are optimized to open quickly.</li>
  <li> Post your project to the web, ensuring that all of your links work</li></ol><br>
<p class="emphasis"> There must be at least two possible endings and there must be multiple ways to get to
each one. </p><br>
  <p><span class="emphasis">Part 1 of the submission should include a brief (one-paragraph) description</span> of your story
(What is the premise? Are there characters? Where does it take place? What are the kinds
of choices you will provide to your user?). It should also <span class="emphasis">include the map of your
    narrative with the forking paths</span> of decisions and <span class="emphasis">one image of a possible scene/space</span> for
your story.</p><br>
      <p><span class="emphasis">Part 2 should include all other aspects</span> of your work; it will be a functioning website following the description above <span class="emphasis"> with the URL provided to your Lab Instructor.</span></p>
  <br>
      <p><span class="emphasis">Tip:</span> If you are having trouble coming up with a story, you could make it location
specific... Define one or more locations in NYC that you find interesting. Document the
location(s) with several photographs. Write a brief story in relation to the location(s) and
give it alternate paths. The story may document something that happened at the location
or something more fantastic. Give your user choices to move through the location(s),
perhaps something different happens in the story or to your user based on the choices.
      </p> <br>
      <p>For the Interactive story assignment, <span class="emphasis">you can create link hotspots on images in this website:</span>
